# Professional Portfolio

## Description

The intent of this project is to have a repository for potential employers and admirers alike to view my projects.
The unfocused items have a reduced opacity for aesthetics.

What I learned from this project is how useful the 'CSS Flexbox' functionality is.
It should be noted that I would employ a couple of more containers, etc, now that it's really in my head that
one can 'Justify' and 'Align' both 'Content' and 'Items'.
Alas, time is of the essence.
